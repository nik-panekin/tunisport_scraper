This script performs image scraping from the Tuni Service website located
at https://www.tunisport.es/. It saves images to a folder and also creates
an Excel file with both images and addition info.

How to use:
    python tunisport_scraper.py

You may interrupt the scraping process and restart it later. The script will
resume from the car brand category next to the previous completely processed.
